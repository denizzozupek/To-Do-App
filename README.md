# To-Do App

A simple and user-friendly To-Do List application built with Python and CustomTkinter.

## About This Project

This project is my beginner-level learning journey in Python. I created this To-Do App to practice GUI programming and task management. It includes features like task categories (Today, Tomorrow, Next Week, Completed, All Tasks), custom lists, and dark/light mode.

## Features

- Add and organize tasks by categories  
- Mark tasks as completed  
- Create and manage custom task lists  
- Save tasks and settings persistently  
- Switch between dark and light modes  

## How to Run

1. Install Python (3.7+ recommended).  
2. Install required packages:  pip install customtkinter pillow tkinter
3. Run the app:  python ToDoApp.py

## Notes

- This is a beginner project. Iâ€™m open to suggestions and feedback.  
- Make sure to keep the `icons` folder with the app in the same directory; otherwise, some icons may not display correctly.
